## Rules & Notation Track

Everything starts with a correct understanding of the board, the pieces, and how to record games. This track reinforces legal move patterns, teaches you to read and write algebraic notation, and walks through setup skills such as building FEN positions from scratch.

Finishing the track means you can join any club or online server and follow recorded lessons without confusion.
