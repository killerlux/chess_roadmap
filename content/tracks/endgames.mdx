## Endgames Track

Endgames reward precision. This track trains you to convert technical positions, manage time effectively in simplified scenarios, and recognize theoretical draws you can hold against stronger players.

Sessions blend drill-based repetition with model endings to build muscle memory for king activity, pawn races, and rook technique.
